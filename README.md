# Orange OS LE 2
Orange OS LE 2 - Electric Boogaloo.

A revival of Orange OS.

We plan to have a install.py which is downloaded and ran after booting up the arch linux installer, and post-install.py which is ran after install.py completes and the system is rebooted.

This OS will have all major AT projects included as links on the desktop or apps.

To test the nightly version, download the latest arch linux ISO [here](https://archlinux.org/download/), then run
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orange-OS-LE/OrangeOSLE2/main/install.py > install.py && python3 install.py
```
